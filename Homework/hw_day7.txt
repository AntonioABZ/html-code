From the many articles on code readability on MDN web doc and in
stack overflow the five key points found in the articles in creating 
good readable code.  Making sure the code has consistency in formatting 
when using braces, naming (variables, classes, methods) and directory 
layout. Two, is having good compact size code that does not take up 
toomuch screen real estate, yet is clear design, well separated between components and has 
a good use of white space. Three is leaving short good useful comments, that don’t over state
the obvious and make redundant comments. Avoiding repetitive code, so as to avoid confusion and
overlooking key codes in addition to not cutting and pasting within the same project,
so as to also avoid repetitive code with mistakes. To write readable code,
I plan to implement the suggestions in the many articles, using good, short meaningful names,
comments that describe the why and the why not’s of the code and the good use of white space.
